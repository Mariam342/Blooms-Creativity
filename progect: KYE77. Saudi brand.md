KEY77 Packaging Design - Elegance and simplicity with graphic creativity

. As a graphic designer, I made sure that the packaging design of the KEY77 bag reflects the identity of the Saudi brand with its modern spirit. I chose the bright white color to express purity and simplicity, while adding the logo in an elegant style to highlight excellence and professionalism.

. I used clean, bold lines in the logo design to make it clear and attractive, ensuring that the brand is easily recognizable and enhances its presence. The bag's design reflects luxury and simplicity at the same time, making the packaging part of a sophisticated and distinctive shopping experience
